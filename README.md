# How to create a new project page
- Go to the main repo: https://github.com/cmicvuw/cmicvuw.github.io
- Click the _projectpages_ folder to bring you to the list of folders of projects.
- Click _Add file_ in the upper right hand corner, then click _Create new folder_.
- In the upper bar _Name your file_, type the shorthand of your project (Note: keep it to less than four words, as this is your URL). 
- Type a forward slash [/] to create the subfolder.
- In the new bar _Name your file_, type index.html and put testing code in the first line of code (like "test"). 
- Scroll down, add a commit message (like "initialise repo"), and Commit new file directly to main branch.
- Now you can clone this repo and edit as needed on the browser or on your computer (clone/add/commit/push).
